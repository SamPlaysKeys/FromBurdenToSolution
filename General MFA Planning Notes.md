## What / So What / Now What
### What
The current perspective on MFA sucks. We can change that. The change needs to start by CS and IT professionals reframing MFA, and adjusting their approach.
### So What
A better perspective from the general public towards MFA will aid adoption, and improve the general security posture as a whole.
### Now What
CS and IT professionals should be able to take the examples/skills demonstrated in this paper and begin working with non-technical users to reframe and improve the perception of MFA.

## Rough Overview
I'm wanting to present/showcase/teach a collection of approaches for presenting conditional access / multi-factor authentication in ways that make it seem helpful or accessible. People are unnecessarily resistant to setting up / using MFA methods because of a lack of comprehension and a gradual rollout. Improving our approach (as individuals, and as a community/industry) can greatly improve not just adoption rates, but encourage best practices, all while building a better perception of security.
## Writing out the goals
My initial thougth was "multifactor authentication: how to spoon-feed it to the people that need it the most", but I don't think that really captures my intent. My goal is to show people how to reframe Multifactor authentication as a bad thing, but as the answer for the daily struggle. This isn't just training for end-users, but for IT and cybersecurity professionals - after all, we are the first step to changing the public perception of multifactor authentication.
